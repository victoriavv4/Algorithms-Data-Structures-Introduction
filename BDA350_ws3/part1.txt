Bubble sort works by comparing pairs of values and swapping them one of the items is greater than the other
(depending on the condition). Following the first iteration through the list, the largest item will be placed at the
end of the list.  The algorithm until all values are placed in the correct order.  However, regardless of whether or
not the items are sorted, the algorithm will still run.  In order to improve this algorithms time complexity, some kind
of flag can be implemented in the inner loop which will notify when a swap has occurred.  If no 2 elements were swapped,
the flag can be set to false and it wil exit the loop, avoiding redundant comparisons.
